# Multi-Objective Community Detection in Brain Networks

Welcome! This repository provides the code and resources for our research on detecting community structures in brain networks using advanced spectral embedding and multi-objective genetic optimization techniques.

Understanding how brain regions organize into functional modules is key to unraveling neural communication and cognition. Our methods improve upon traditional approaches by integrating anatomical spatial constraints with topological modularity to produce biologically meaningful, reproducible brain network partitions.

Browse the folders and scripts here to find everything to get started, from data preprocessing to running genetic community detection and visualizing results. Follow the instructions in this README to install dependencies, execute analyses, and cite our work.
